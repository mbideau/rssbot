```

### Management messages

To manage users subscription and feeds, you send email message to the IMAP mailbox with a specific syntax.
Basically, you use a predefined subject, and, if required, a feed url in the mail body.
Predefined subjects are :

- **Subscribe** : the user subscribe to the service, its email is registered.
- **Unsubscribe** : the user unsubscribe to the service, all its feeds are deleted.
- **Add** : the user add a feed to its collection. The feed url must be given in the mail body.
- **Delete** : the user delete a feed to its collection. The feed url must be given in the mail body.
- **List** : the user list its feeds collection.

Every subject is translated according to the 'lang' parameter defined in the configuration file.   
The translations files must exists in `locales/rssbot.<locale>.yml`.  
To list the available subjects/actions in the choosen language, run `python 3 rssbot.py -l`.


### Planed execution

In order to fetch RSS feeds and send message, add the following command to your crontab (or like) :
```
rssbot/bin/python rssbot/rssbot.py --fetch-all
```
I recommend planing it once a day, at night.

To read and process management messages, add that to your crontab (or like) :
```
rssbot/bin/python rssbot/rssbot.py --manage
```
I recommend to plan it to every 15 minutes if you have a lot of users, else every hour.
Personaly, I plan it every night (I only have a few users).

## Notes

It uses logging as output, so adjust verbosity by adjusting the log level.

It was made and tested on Linux without any knowledge of Windows environment, so it may or may not work on Windows.

It was not unit-tested, but was exhaustively tested with real cases usage.

It is in production for myself since 2016 with a few users since end of 2019.
